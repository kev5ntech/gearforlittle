        <p class="text-neutral-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          I'm a software engineer and a dad to [child's name], born in [year]. When my partner and I started building our registry, I did what engineers do: I opened a spreadsheet and started researching.
        </p>
        <p class="text-neutral-600 leading-relaxed">
          Six weeks later, I had 40 tabs open, three conflicting "best of" lists, and zero confidence in any of them. Every review site I found was either recycling manufacturer specs or clearly optimizing for affiliate clicks over honesty.

    <!-- Why I Started This Site -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mb-5">Why I Started This Site</h2>
      <div class="prose prose-neutral max-w-none">
        <p class="text-neutral-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The baby gear industry is a mess. Products are marketed with vague claims ("ultra-lightweight!" "easy to fold!"), prices are all over the place, and most review sites are ranking products by affiliate commission, not actual quality.
        </p>
        <p class="text-neutral-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          I bought the gear anyway, figured it out the hard way, and kept notes on all of it. After a year of parenting and testing, I had enough real-world data to actually be useful. So I built this site.
        </p>
        <p class="text-neutral-600 leading-relaxed">
          GearForLittle is what I wish had existed when I was frantically Googling at 11pm. It's not trying to be everything to everyone. It's just one dad's thorough, honest take on the gear that actually matters.
